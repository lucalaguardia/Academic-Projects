# Academic Projects
This repository aims to be a portfolio consisting of the main university assignments I worked on during my master's degree in Aerospace Engineering at the Politecnico di Torino.

# Courses
- ***Orbital Robotics and Distributed Space Systems***
  > Analysis S/W tool for the planar orbital and attitude/configuration motion of a satellite-robotic manipulator system orbiting Earth
- ***Advanced Rocket Propulsion and Access to Space***
  > ∆𝑉 required for ascent and insertion into LEO and GEO
  
  > Staging I: payload of a rocket for transfer into LEO and GTO, considering a variable number of stages and different combinations of propellant
  
  > Staging II: insertion of a TSTO into LEO, considering different combinations of propellant for the two stages
  
  > Settling and Vanes: propellant mass required for the settling of the two stages of a TSTO assuming different thrust configurations
